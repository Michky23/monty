# This project contain details about Stack and Queues in C - Stack operations and Queue operations.

## 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Learning Objectives:

- What do LIFO and FIFO mean

- What is a stack, and when to use it

- What is a queue, and when to use it

- What are the common implementations of stacks and queues

- What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues

- What is the proper way to use global variables

## Definitions:

### A stack in C is nothing but a linear data structure that follows the LIFO rule (Last In First Out). In a stack, both insertion and deletion take place from just one end, that is, from the top.

### In contrast to a stack, a queue in C is nothing but a linear data structure that follows the FIFO rule (First In First Out). Insertion is done from the back (the rear end) and deletion is done from the front.
